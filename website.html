        <p>Brownies were created in the late 19th century by accident when a baker forgot to add baking powder,
             resulting in a dense, fudgy treat that quickly became a beloved dessert!Brownies became popular in the early 20th century when a Chicago baker added melted chocolate to a cookie recipe, creating a rich, 
             chewy dessert that's now enjoyed worldwide in many variations!In 1893, the first published brownie recipe appeared in the "Boston Cooking School Cook Book," with a unique ingredient: unsweetened chocolate, 
             which gives brownies their signature rich, decadent flavor.</p>

             <p>Pizza originated in Italy, but the first pizzeria in the U.S. opened in 1905 in New York.
                 Today, more than 3 billion pizzas are sold worldwide every year!The world’s largest pizza, measuring 1261.65 square meters, was made in Rome in 2012.
                  It was called “Ottavia” and was gluten-free to promote health-conscious eating alongside its massive size!Pizza was originally a street food in Naples, Italy, served to the poor. 
                  It became globally popular after World War II, especially after American soldiers tasted it while stationed in Italy!</p>
